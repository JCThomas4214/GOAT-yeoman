_The GOATyeoman generator is located [here](https://github.com/JCThomas4214/GOAT-yeoman)_

### **GOATstack uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) package manager and is required for package consistancy**

# Quick Start 

```sh
$ [sudo] yarn global add yo generator-goatstack
$ mkdir [dirName] && cd [dirName]
$ [sudo] yo goatstack [name?]
$ # Make sure to have the database runnning!!
$ [sudo] yarn start
$ # dev environment served to http://localhost:1701
```

# What's New in v4.3?

**_WARNING: v4.0.x => v4.3.x brings BREAKING CHANGES CassMask was removed to make GOATstack less opinionated_**

* CassMask is no longer be used, or supported. This will be a breaking change from past versions.
* In place of CassMask we will use the [Cassandra Node.js driver](https://github.com/datastax/nodejs-driver) which is compatible with DataStax enterprise solutions.

# Future updates in v4.4.x!

* Sequelize will be worked on.
* Server-side rendering with [Angular Universal](https://universal.angular.io/)
  * Angular Universal will be integrated into @angular/core upon [angular@4.x](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
  * we will begin refactoring on the GOATv4 branch once rc.1 publishes in the coming month
  
 # Beyond the Horizon. V5.x.x and Angular 5!
 
 * Angular 5 is in beta currently, and has a release target for mid October 2017. We plan on integrating Angular 5 and releasing it in Version 5.0.0 of the GOATstack in the 4th quarter.

# Why GOAT-stack?

![Houston we have a problem](https://github.com/JCThomas4214/Documentation/raw/master/GOAT/assets/Houston-we-have-a-problem-banner.jpg?raw=true)

<a name="problem"></a>
## Problem

<img src="https://github.com/JCThomas4214/Documentation/raw/master/GOAT/assets/critical-space-ship.png?raw=true" align="right">

### 1. Initial page load speed 
 * 40% of users leave a webpage that takes more than 3 seconds to load
 
### 2. Scaleable resources
 * If an App's resources cannot scale with real time user traffic it will crash during traffic spikes, and be wasteful when there is low user activity

### 3. Scaleable Architecture
 * If a program's dataflow is not structured conicously a once easily managed program made of 10,000 lines of code becomes a hinderance once it reaches 100,000 lines of code. Data flows become unruley and nested, and unintended dependencies occur in the application tree. This makes maintainability a mess, and refactoring a nightmare.

### 4. User to User real time interaction
 * User interaction is a key success factor in regards to having a community adopt, and grow with your projet. The more seamless user interaction is with your website, and with each other, the better chance the project has at success.

## Solution

<img src="https://github.com/JCThomas4214/Documentation/raw/master/GOAT/assets/optimized-space-ship.png?raw=true" align="right">

### 1. Initial page load speed 
 * The GOAT stack capitilizes on Angular2's [Ahead-of-Time](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html) server-side compilation. Having the server do the heavy lifting at build time allows us to serve pre-compiled views for the client to load. This dramatically decreases initial load time.
 
### 2. Scaleable resources
 * MongoDB fits the developer paradigm very well. with proper [indexing](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/) and [schema design](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/core/data-model-design/) database response times will be linear, or consant. Also, the capability of [sharding](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/) removes the bottle-neck of datasize. 

### 3. Scaleable Architecture
 * [Immmutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) makes app data predictable at any scale, and [redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/) makes dataflow manageble by eliminating many-to-many relationships, this completely removes tangled nests of components, making them more modular. Redux places the entire app's [state tree](http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html#state) in one focal area which is the [store](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/Store.html). 

### 4. User to User real time interaction
 * Angular2's [two way data binding](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html#!#two-way) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) is an effective combination. Two way data binding allows real time interaction between website and client without the need to reload pages. Socket.io takes this one step further and automatically updates changes on every connected device in real time without the need to refresh the browser. This feature can be narrowed or widened.
